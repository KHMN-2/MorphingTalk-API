# UserVoiceModel Entity Framework Tracking Issue - FIXED

## Problem
The application was throwing an error: 
```
"message": "Internal server error: Unable to track an entity of type 'UserVoiceModel' because its primary key property 'Id' is null."
```

## Root Cause
The issue occurred because:

1. **Missing Primary Key**: When creating a new `UserVoiceModel` entity, the `Id` property (string type) was not being set, causing Entity Framework to be unable to track the entity.

2. **Missing Foreign Key**: The `User` entity was missing the `VoiceModelId` foreign key property that should reference the `UserVoiceModel.Id`.

3. **Incomplete DbContext Configuration**: The `UserVoiceModel` entity was not properly configured in the `ApplicationDbContext`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Missing Primary Key Generation
```csharp
// VoiceTrainingController.cs
var voiceModelId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
user.VoiceModel = new UserVoiceModel
{
    Id = voiceModelId, // Generate unique ID
    TaskId = taskId,
    Name = user.FullName + "_" + user.NativeLanguage,
    CreatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow,
    Status = UserVoiceModelStatus.Training
};
user.VoiceModelId = voiceModelId; // Set the foreign key
```

### 2. Added Foreign Key Property to User Entity
```csharp
// Domain/Entities/Users/User.cs
public string? VoiceModelId { get; set; } // Foreign key
public UserVoiceModel? VoiceModel { get; set; }
```

### 3. Updated ApplicationDbContext
```csharp
// Infrastructure/Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs
public DbSet<UserVoiceModel> UserVoiceModels { get; set; }

// Configure User-UserVoiceModel relationship
builder.Entity<User>()
    .HasOne(u => u.VoiceModel)
    .WithMany()
    .HasForeignKey(u => u.VoiceModelId)
    .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.SetNull);
```

### 4. Database Migration Applied
- Created migration: `AddVoiceModelIdToUser`
- Added `VoiceModelId` column to Users table
- Updated database schema successfully

## Result
âœ… **FIXED**: The VoiceTrainingController now successfully creates and tracks UserVoiceModel entities without Entity Framework tracking errors.

## Test Endpoints
```http
POST /api/VoiceTraining/train
GET /api/VoiceTraining/status
```

Both endpoints should now work correctly without throwing the tracking error.
