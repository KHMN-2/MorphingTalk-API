### Test Blocking Feature Endpoints

### 1. Get all blocked users (requires authentication)
### Returns only users YOU have blocked, not users who blocked you
GET https://localhost:7001/api/Friendship/blocked
Authorization: Bearer {{token}}

### 2. Block a user (requires authentication)
### Only you can block another user - this creates a one-way block
POST https://localhost:7001/api/Friendship/block/user@example.com
Authorization: Bearer {{token}}

### 3. Unblock a user (requires authentication)
### You can only unblock users that YOU previously blocked
### Users who blocked you cannot be unblocked by you
POST https://localhost:7001/api/Friendship/unblock/user@example.com
Authorization: Bearer {{token}}

### 4. Get friends (should exclude blocked users)
GET https://localhost:7001/api/Friendship
Authorization: Bearer {{token}}

### Important Notes:
### - Replace {{token}} with your actual JWT token
### - Replace user@example.com with the actual email of the user you want to block/unblock
### - Blocking is one-way: if User A blocks User B, only User A can unblock User B
### - Blocked users cannot create conversations with each other
### - The /blocked endpoint only shows users YOU blocked, not users who blocked you
